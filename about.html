<h1>Flickr Tag Frequencies User Goal</h1>
<p>Our user goal is for people to be able to explore data that is mainly categorized by machine tags. They should be able to see different correlations between capture device, season, hour of day the picture was taken, and the frequency the machine tag shows up. The motivation is for people to see how machine tags are connected through these different facets. </p>
<p>The drop down menu contains the top devices used in the data set, and the seasons to sort the machine tags by. The sliders to the left are for the frequency fo the tags, and the most popular hour in the day that tag was taken at. When used in combination with eachother, these tags can produce interesting results. </p>
